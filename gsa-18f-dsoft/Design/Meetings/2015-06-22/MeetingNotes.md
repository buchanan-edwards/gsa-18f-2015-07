#Meetings on June 22nd, 2015#

On Monday 22 June 2015, the DSoft Technology Agile Team (Business Analyst and Visual Designer) met with two of its customers (Researcher and Financial Analyst) to review the initial paper prototypes developed for them as a result of the initial participatory meetings and white boarding. The paper prototypes were developed last week and over the weekend.

The customers were mostly receptive to the paper prototypes, but provided a variety of new layout and functionality suggestions, some of which will have to be deferred until the next sprint.  Ideas which came up include the ability to email a graphic, save a graphic, export a graphic to PDF, and CAPTCHA on the contact form.

The Researcher customer indicates that placement of the filtering controls for the resultant graphic is not intuitive because they required the user to switch back and forth between various controls in order for the graphic to display.  Instead she suggested top-to-bottom filter controls with a [Submit] or [Filter] button.

Results of the paper prototyping meeting were then provided to the Technical Architect who updated the use cases and the class diagrams.
