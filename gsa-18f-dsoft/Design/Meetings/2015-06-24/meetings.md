# Meetings on 24 June 2015 #

24 June 2015 - 2 per day Scrum discussions centered on the week ahead's schedule, roadblocks and status of prototypes. Product Manager worked through ADS labor categories, mapping and descriptions.

At the end of daily scrum, an important issue was noted WRT data availability in the open.fda.gov API.  The data originally thought to be in the FDA dataset will not provide the required report and data for the Financial Analyst.  As a result, a meeting was scheduled with the financial analyst to re-review her requirements.  The meeting consisted of a paper prototype session as shown below where the Visual Designer provided paper prototypes for review and consideration.
