1. In selecting a service platform for hosting, is the platform’s inherent continuous monitoring capability sufficient to satisfy the evaluation criteria (item #8 in Pool 2)?
1. WRT the statement about “modern and open-source frontend or client-side web technologies”, does this also refer to the operating system used on the hosting environment?
1. Can Attachment E (spreadsheet) cross reference README.md?
