# Sprint 2 (6/29 - 7/12)

On Monday, June 29, the team met with the Product Manager and conducted the show-and-tell (current state of the prototype).  At that meeting, it was determined that the About page content needed additional information and that one of the outstanding bugs not fixed in Sprint 1 needed to be addressed, Bug #23.

All other user stories identified in Sprint 2 that addressed new functionality would not be worked on based on the delivery date of the final proposal (1 July 2015).

With the proposal due date moved to 7 July, the Product Manager also determined that no more effort was needed on the prototype. 

Screen shots of the Agile sprinter for June 29 and July 2 were taken and can be found in /Design/Sprint 2 Documents
