#Usability Testing (26 June)
On June 26, 0900 hours, the Usability testing participants arrived and signed in on the DSoft Visitor Log-in sheet (per DSoft Technology's Corporate Security Standard Practice Procedures). 

After all of the participants had arrived, the facilitator and note keeper introduced themselves and then requested each participant to introduce themselves (first name only) and if they had brought any mobile devices with them.  The facilitator stated that their personal information would be not be used in any report and that the need to sign-in was required as DSoft Technology holds a Department of Defense facility clearance. 

The facilitator then thanked them for their time, reviewed some administrative items (restrooms, fire exits etc.) and then following the procedures as described in the Usability Test Plan (located under Test/UsabilityTestPlan.md), conducted the usability testing.

A picture of the test setup is shown below (to protect participants identities, we asked them to go out into the hall).

A sample questionnaire filled in by participants can be found in the Test/ folder.  

All issues reported by users were entered into the Issue tracker.

Initial results of the Usability Testing were presented to the development team at a meeting on 26 June 15, 1300 hours.  Issues/suggested enhancements  that could be fixed in the current sprint were assigned. Issues/enhancements that could not be fixed in the current sprint were deferred to the next sprint (Sprint 2).
