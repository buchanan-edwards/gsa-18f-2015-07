#### Recommendations
The following recommendations were made by participants:<br/>
1.	Long names overflow into the graph, try filter on Alabama <br/>
2.	Users didn't understand the meaning of the different size of circles. <br/>
3.	Text at top of the report was confusing.<br/>


#### General Recommendations
The greatest number of comments was when we asked the users to just explore and play after they had completed the specific test tasks.  The following recommendations were made by participants and the development team:

1. Add a home button, as users didn't know that they could select the logo to get back to home page.<br/>
2. Selecting Captcha should enable the [Send] and vice versa. <br/>
3. DSoft logo can't be read, need a clearer image.<br/>
4. Yellow warning bar across the top doesn't have a strong contrast.  Probably the text should be centered as well.<br/>
5. Font on the menu using Chrome is really small. 
6. Text on the home page for the business and recall trend reports is confusing.<br/>
7. Users didn't know why there was a horizontal bar between the three graphical reports and the Reports List. Renaming the reports list to Food Recall Reports would be more descriptive.<br/>
8. Several users stated that on the home page they expected to be able to link to the reports by selecting the image. <br/>
9. In Chrome, the glyphicons font isn't loading correctly, errors were occurring.

## Consolidated Recommendations to Review

Further data analysis from the demographic and background information questionnaire, post-task questionnaires and satisfaction questionnaire will be performed in Sprint #2 to improve usability. A final report will be conducted in Sprint #2 and reviewed by the development team.

An initial Usability Testing Review was conducted on 26 June 2015, 0900 hours to examine the specific issues reported by the usability testing participants.  The following severity criteria were used to assess the issues identified during the Usability Testing.

<b>Severity 1</b> - High impact problems that often prevent a user from correctly completing a task.  They occur in varying frequency and are characteristic of calls to the Help Desk.  Reward for resolution is typically exhibited in fewer Help Desk calls and reduced redevelopment costs.<br/><br/>
<b>Severity 2</b> - Moderate to high frequency problems with moderate to low impact are typical of erroneous actions that the participant recognizes needs to be undone.  Reward for resolution is typically exhibited in reduced time on task and decreased training costs.<br/><br/>
<b>Severity 3</b> - Either moderate problems with low frequency or low problems with moderate frequency; these are minor annoyance problems faced by a number of participants.  Reward for resolution is typically exhibited in reduced time on task and increased data integrity.<br/><br/>
<b>Severity 4</b> - Low impact problems faced by few participants; there is low risk to not resolving these problems. Reward for resolution is typically exhibited in increased user satisfaction.<br/>

The development team meet on 26 June 2015, 1300 hours and stated that many of the issues recorded in the issue tracker reported by the usability team could be addressed in the current sprint.  

See https://github.com/DSoftTechnology/ADS-FDA-Pool3/issues

Some additional comments from the development team during the meeting were also collected.<br/>

1. Unit tests need to be updated to support async calls.</br>
2. Need to put version of the software on the footer with date.<br/>


By the end of the day, only three issues/enhancements remained open that will be addressed in the next Sprint (Sprint 2).  **20 issues were closed.** 

See https://github.com/DSoftTechnology/ADS-FDA-Pool3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed

Estimates on the level of effort for the three remaining issues will be determined during the Scrum Planning meeting scheduled for 29 June 2015.
