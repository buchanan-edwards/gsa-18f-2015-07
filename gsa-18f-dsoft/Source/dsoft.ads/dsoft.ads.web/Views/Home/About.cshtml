			<p>DSoft Technology, a Colorado Springs-based Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), is a leading provider 
			of IT services and solutions for a broad range of clients both locally here in Colorado and across the country. Since 1992, 
			DSoft Technology has proven success delivering strategic value and operational efficiencies to our clients, specializing in .NET, 
			open source, and Umbraco technologies. Our formula for success is a thoughtful combination of people, clients, and culture that 
			makes the difference. We don't invent technology -- we just make IT work for our clients. Our first two goals are 1) to run our 
			business in harmony with God's laws, 2) to focus on people more than money.</p>
			<p>DSoft Technology implements an Agile paradigm using sprint architecture with three phases: staging, development, and wrapping. 
			With the customer's involvement during the staging phase, product vision is established and software features are identified.  The 
			team prioritizes each feature with the customer and estimates the level of effort for each. The product backlog, consisting of 
			prioritized software features, gives the development team a solid foundation for establishing a sprint backlog for the development 
			phase. The product backlog gives the team and the customer a clear understanding of what has to be done to produce a desirable product.</p>
			<p>In an Agile paradigm, every aspect of software development is  continually revisited. When a team stops and re-evaluates the  project 
			direction every two weeks during sprint reviews, there's  time for corrections. The inherent flexibility of Scrum-managed  teams 
			maximizes the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond  to emerging requirements.</p>
