## Design

1. assigned one leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
1. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum three of the labor categories limited to the Design Pool Labor categories to design the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services.
1. understand what people need, by including people (see note #1) in the prototype design process
1. used at least three “human-centered design” techniques or tools
1. created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library
1. used at least three modern (see Note#2) and open source frontend or client side (see note #3) web technologies 
1. performed usability tests with people
1. used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
1. created a prototype that works on multiple devices and presents a responsive design
1. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
1. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.

Notes: (#1) The government understands it will be difficult to find people who would be credible
actual users of the prototype, given the dataset. “People” here is to be understood as anyone not
directly involved in the design or development of the prototype. Subsequent use of the word
“People” in all the criteria should be understood to have the same definition as described in this
footnote.

(#2) “Modern” is to be understood as any technology or standard released, created, initiated or
finalized in the 5 years preceding the release of this RFQ. Any subsequent use of the word
“Modern” in these criteria is to be understood as having the same definition as described in this
note.

(#3) Either term, frontend or client-side is meant to be understood as a code that is executed
within a user-agent, most commonly in this context a web browser.

## Development

1. assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
1. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services
1. used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend etc)
1. deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider was used
1. wrote unit tests for their code
1. set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider
1. set up or used configuration management
1. set up or used continuous monitoring
1. deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization)
1. used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype 
1. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
1. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge 

## Staff

- includes at a minimum five of the labor categories from the Full Stack Pool categories.
