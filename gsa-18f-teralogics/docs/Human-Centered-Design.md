## Framing — _Frame The Design_

Development team worked directly with end users from day one to frame out their problems, preferences, and unmet needs related to accessing and understanding food product recalls.  The team iteratively worked through the scope of the issues, created user stories, and determined viable options by asking the questions below:

1. How can we collect and centralize data about defective products?
2. How can we make the information quickly understandable to the user?
3. How can we display the information that is most relevant to the user?

These questions, along with various design and feedback sessions, helped to drive the development of the final prototype solution.

### User Stories and Ideas

## Ideation — _Get Visual_

When designing the prototype, the Delivery Team created visual mockups of the user interface to create an initial plan for displaying the dataset to users. The design considered: how users would interact with the prototype and from what range of devices; and, how users currently access the kinds of data that the prototype would display. One design goal was to ensure that the prototype was intuitive and required no training or prior experience to use. User feedback was collected in the first sprint iteration, using the design review tool [InVision](/docs/Tools.md#invision). This influenced a simple, clean design approach which incorporated user feedback to refine how users access, view, and share the displayed data.

## Implementation — _Live Prototyping_

During the development stages of the sprint cycles, the team employed rapid prototyping to quickly build and test various components of the prototype, including localizing product defect information and formatting product information display. The prototype was deployed to a publicly-available repository ([GitHub](/docs/Tools.md#github)), and end users were engaged again to review the first iteration of the prototype, providing real-time feedback for incorporation in the second sprint cycle.
