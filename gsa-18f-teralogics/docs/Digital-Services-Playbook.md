| |Digital Service Plays |      Evidence |
|---   |---   |---   |
| 1 | Understand what people need |  The delivery team spends time directly with end users to understand their needs and how they intend to use the application. The team interaction is primarily through iterative user interviews, design reviews and hands-on usability testing. Requirements and user feedback translate to user stories or requirements that are prioritized for sprint execution. <br> [User Feedback Group] (/docs/User-Feedback-Group.md) <br> [Human Centered Design] (/docs/Human-Centered-Design.md) <br> [Usability Testing] (/docs/Usability-Testing.md) <br> [Responsive Design] (/docs/Responsive-Design.md)| 
| 2 | Address the whole experience, from start to finish    |   Our design approach takes into account the multiple ways in which users interact with the application, whether it's through a desktop browser or on their mobile device. We work with end users throughout the agile development lifecycle to ensure we solve for their primary pain points and enhance their overall experience. <br> [Usability Testing] (/docs/Usability-Testing.md) <br> [Front End Design Evoluton] (/docs/Front-End-Design-Evolution.md)   |  
| 3 | Make it simple and intuitive | Throughout the agile development process, our goal is always to make applications simple, intuitive, and easy to use. Our approach for the prototype was to develop a design style guide that was flexible enough to meet end user needs and present information in a clear and meaningful way. <br> [Design Style Guide] (/docs/Style-Guide.md) |  
| 4 | Build the service using agile and iterative practices | Our small development team built the prototype application following an iterative two-day sprint cycle approach. Each cycle focused on planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying a solution based on prioritized backlog of user requirements. We elicited user feedback throughout the first cycle to drive the priorities for the second cycle. <br> [Development and Design Process] (/docs/Development-and-Design-Process.md) <br> [Continuous Integration] (/docs/Continuous-Integration.md) <br> [Continuous Monitoring] (/docs/Continuous-Monitoring.md) <br> [Front End Design Evolution](/docs/Front-End-Design-Evolution.md) <br> [Back End Design Evolution](/docs/Backend-Design-Evolution.md) |
| 5 | Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery | Although this play was not required for the 18F ADS I RFQ response, our team has significant experience with scheduling, budgeting, and execution for agile development projects/contracts. Our team works with various government and private-sector contracting offices to ensure agile deliverables are focused, innovative, and impactful, while minimizing cost and schedule risks.|
| 6 | Assign one leader and hold that person accountable | Our team assigned the Product Manager as the primary Product Owner who is accountable for the delivery of the prototype application. Our Product Owner worked with end users to set the appropriate goals, tasks, and assignments for the sprints. The Product Owner advised the development team on technical solutions as needed to ensure that the final solution aligned with end user needs. <br> [Agile Delivery Team] (/docs/Agile-Delivery-Team.md) |
| 7 | Bring in experienced teams | Our team combines skills and experience across various software-development and delivery platforms to build high-impact and robust solutions.  We bring tools and processes refined through years of experience designing, developing, and deploying web applications for critical mission systems. Our expertise was put into action as part of the working prototype delivered for the 18F ADS I RFQ response. <br> [Agile Delivery Team] (/docs/Agile-Delivery-Team.md) <br> [Tools] (/docs/Tools.md) <br> [Develop and Design Process] (/docs/Development-and-Design-Process.md) <br> [Continuous Integration] (/docs/Continuous-Integration.md) <br> [Continuous Monitoring] (/docs/Continuous-Monitoring.md) |
| 8 | Choose a modern technology stack |  The team used various modern, open-source technologies for building out the prototype. Information on which technologies we used in each layer are included in the following wiki links. <br> [Front End Technologies] (/docs/Frontend-Technologies.md) <br> [Back End Techologies] (/docs/Backend-Technologies.md) |
| 9 | Deploy in a flexible hosting environment | Our team is experienced in multiple IaaS and PaaS solutions, and selected Heroku for our RFQ response.  Our application can easily scale up for production by simply deploying additional front and backend instances on the PaaS. <br> [Platform as a Service](/docs/Platform-as-a-Service.md) |
| 10 | Automate testing and deployments | Our team uses best-of-breed tools to automate testing and continuously deploy to development and production servers throughout the sprint cycles.  We deploy our code to production quickly and prevent errors through robust automated testing and thorough code coverage. <br> [Continuous Integration] (/docs/Continuous-Integration.md) <br> [Continuous Monitoring] (/docs/Continuous-Monitoring.md) |
| 11 | Manage security and privacy through reusable processes | Although security and privacy requirements are not explicitly called out in the 18F ADS I RFQ response, we have applied best practices to our solution.  We use SSL encryption between client and server and store user information in a secure database.  |
| 12 | Use data to drive decisions |  Our application uses several different monitoring technologies to monitor system uptime, throughput, response time, and memory utilization. These tools ensure we are aware of how well the application is running and whether there are issues impacting our users. <br> [Continuous Monitoring] (/docs/Continuous-Monitoring.md)|
| 13 | Default to open | The prototype application and associated source code are available through our public Github repository under the MIT license. This repository contains a detailed overview of our Agile development processes, including this document. Documentation for our API is available on the deployment itself at `/docs/api`. <br> [Open Source Repository] (https://github.com/TeraLogics/TotalBriecall) <br> <a href="https://www.totalbriecall.com/docs/api/" target="_blank">API Documentation</a> <br> [Agile Tools] (/docs/Tools.md) |
