            <ol>
                <li><strong><em>What do the classes mean?</em></strong>
                    <p>The classes refer to the severity of the recall. Per the FDA's website:</p>

                    <p>Class I recall: a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.</p>

                    <p>Class II recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.</p>

                    <p>Class III recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.</p>

                    <p>In the map, the classes are represented by color. Class I is blue, Class II is green, and Class III is yellow.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>There are three types of pins: those with empty circles, full circles, and circles with an X inside them. What do these represent?</em></strong>
                    <p>The pins represent recalls in a given geographic location. Aside from color, there are three unique shapes that comprise the pins on the map. The open circles represent ongoing recalls, the closed circles represent recalls that are completed, and the pins with Xs represent recalls that were terminated.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>What is the crowdsourced feedback?</em></strong>
                    <p>Here users may provide input via the thumbs up or thumbs down icons to indicate if the map accurately displays issues surrounding the affected area. </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>What is the difference between Report Date and Initiation Date?</em></strong>
                    <p>As their names might suggest, the Report Date represents the date the recall was first reported, while the Initiation Date is the date when the recall was put into effect.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>What is the limit of the data displayed on the map?</em></strong>
                    <p>The map shows a maximum of 100 data points at a time. To narrow down a result, simply use the filters at the top of the navigation.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>How far back does the data go?</em></strong>
                    <p>The data available dates back to 2010. </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>Why are other states highlighted when I click on a pin on the map?</em></strong>
                    <p>When a user is searching for details on a particular area, they may click on a pin. When this happens, other affected areas will be highlighted.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>How can I get access to the data?</em></strong>
                    <p>The data is available in the APIs are downloadable as a CSV file through the map's download function.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>What is the default when I log in? </em></strong>
                    <p>When the map is first loaded, a nationwide view of 100 data points is displayed.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>Can I see the latest issues in my area?</em></strong>
                    <p>Using the status filter, users may view food recalls that are completed, terminated or ongoing. </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>How can I search for results in my location?</em></strong>
                    <p>Users may filter by state, use the map to navigate to your location, or click on the Current Location icon Current Location icon, which allows your browser to access your current location using GPS/IP address.</p>
                </li> 
                <li><strong><em>Where can I sign up for food recall alerts?</em></strong>
                    <p>This site currently does not offer alerts for food recalls.  The FDA has created an alert website that allows users to view current recalls and sign up for alerts.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/" target="_blank" class="faq_link">http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/</a></p>
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>What are the different recall status codes for the foods and what do they mean?</em></strong>
                    <p>Ongoing: A recall which is currently in progress.</p>
                    <p>Completed: The recall action reaches the point at which the firm has actually retrieved and impounded all outstanding product that could reasonably be expected to be recovered, or has completed all product corrections.</p>
                    <p>Terminated: FDA has determined that all reasonable efforts have been made to remove or correct the violative product in accordance with the recall strategy, and proper disposition has been made according to the degree of hazard.</p>
