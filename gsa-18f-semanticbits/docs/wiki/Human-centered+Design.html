</div></p><h1 id="Human-centeredDesign-Background">Background</h1><p>These are the user-centered design standards/best-practices that we apply.</p><h2 id="Human-centeredDesign-ISOStandard">ISO Standard</h2><p><span>ISO 9241-210:2010 provides requirements and recommendations for human-centred design principles and activities throughout the life cycle of computer-based interactive systems. It is intended to be used by those managing design processes, and is concerned with ways in which both hardware and software components of interactive systems can enhance human–system interaction.</span></p><p>Human-centred design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.</p><p>The ISO standard describes 6 key principles that will ensure a design is user centered:</p><ol><li>The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.</li><li>Users are involved throughout design and development.</li><li>The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.</li><li>The process is iterative.</li><li>The design addresses the whole user experience.</li><li>The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.</li></ol><h2 id="Human-centeredDesign-IDEO">IDEO</h2><p>IDEO.org is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to applying human-centered design to alleviate poverty.  IDEO.org is dedicated innovation, great design, and changing lives.  </p><p>Human-centered design is a creative approach to problem solving. It’s a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs. Human-centered design is all about building a deep empathy with the people you’re designing for; generating tons of ideas; building a bunch of prototypes; sharing what you’ve made with the people you’re designing for; and eventually putting your innovative new solution out in the world.</p><p>Human-centered design consists of three phases. In the Inspiration Phase you’ll learn directly from the people you’re designing for as you immerse yourself in their lives and come to deeply understand their needs. In the Ideation Phase you’ll make sense of what you learned, identify opportunities for design, and prototype possible solutions. And in the Implementation Phase you’ll bring your solution to life, and eventually, to market. And you’ll know that your solution will be a success because you’ve kept the very people you’re looking to serve at the heart of the process.</p><h1 id="Human-centeredDesign-UseintheLABELapplication">Use in the LABEL application</h1><p>Following is a description of how we use each of these standards in the LABEL application.</p><h2 id="Human-centeredDesign-ISOStandardUseinLABEL">ISO Standard Use in LABEL</h2><ol><li>The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.<br /><br />One of the initial tasks was for us to define our user base, which is the general public that is interested in learning more about their prescription or over-the-counter drug.  We understand that they will be searching mostly with free text, occasionally by an image of the barcode on their medication, and less frequently by specific fields.  Furthermore, they'll be using their desktop or mobile device.<br /><br /></li><li>Users are involved throughout design and development.<br /><br />We incorporated user involved from day one, reviewing <a href="Wireframes.html">wireframes</a>, <a href="Mockups.html">mockups</a>, prototype, and release implementation.<br /> </li><li>The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.<br /><br />Feedback was documented, evaluated, and incorporated at <a href="Schedule.html">each step</a> (iteration).<br /> </li><li>The process is iterative.<br /><br />Because of the short timeline, we iterated every single day.<br /> </li><li>The design addresses the whole user experience.<br /><br />The design addressed the user experience on different platforms and at every aspect of the application.<br /> </li><li>The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.<br /><br />The design team included a UI Design specialist, project manager, and product owner, providing a wide array of perspectives. </li></ol><h2 id="Human-centeredDesign-IDEOFieldGuideUseinLABEL">IDEO Field Guide Use in LABEL</h2><p>The LABEL project utilized the following Human-centered Design techniques or tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Create a Project Plan</strong>: created a project plan with key design milestones, review sessions, etc.</li><li><strong>Build a Team</strong>: <a href="Team.html">our team</a> included a Product Owner, Lead Designer, Project Manager, and stakeholders/users</li><li><strong>Group Interview</strong>: during design review sessions, got feedback on needs</li><li><strong>Define Your Audience</strong>: early on we determined our audience would be the general public, not specialists, physicians, or the government (though those people could be part of the general public)</li><li><strong>Analogous Inspiration</strong>: we used Google.com as an &quot;analogous&quot; search engine to look at for presenting results of free-text searches</li><li><strong>Draw It</strong>: we used <a href="Users.html">interactive wireframing sessions</a></li><li><strong>Find Themes</strong>: we looked through our notes on our design sessions and identified a theme around clearly marking the purpose of buttons/links</li><li><strong>Brainstorm</strong>: the early iterations of the design brainstormed on many ideas, such as focusing the entire application on barcodes to using rules to help find adverse events</li><li><strong>Get Visual</strong>: we used <a href="Wireframes.html">wireframes</a> to visualize the design</li><li><strong>Create a Concept</strong>: we used <a href="Mockups.html">mockups</a> to conceptualize the design</li><li><strong>Gut Check</strong>: the Product Owner and Project Manager took a gut check on results of design sessions and tossed some ideas due to time constraints and kept others that seemed to really &quot;matter&quot; to the users</li><li><strong>Determine What to Prototype</strong>: as part of our iterative approach, the most important features to users were placed first in the list</li><li><strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong>: our prototyping work implemented the initial user interface in a single day</li><li><strong>Get Feedback</strong>: through iteration on <a href="Wireframes.html">wireframes</a>, <a href="Mockups.html">mockups</a>, prototype, and implementation we were able to gather feedback at each step</li><li><strong>Integrate Feedback and Iterate</strong>: each step mentioned above incorporated feedback gathered from the previous step</li><li><strong>Roadmap</strong>: we created an initial <a href="Schedule.html">roadmap</a> for the project that incorporated users at every single step</li><li><strong>Staff Your Project</strong>: we <a href="Team.html">staffed</a> our project with a wide array of resources and roles</li><li><strong>Keep Iterating</strong>: we iterated on the design and implementation every single day</li></ul>
