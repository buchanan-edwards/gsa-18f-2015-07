                    <p>In order to really understand what people need, we have included &quot;users&quot; from the beginning of the project.  These are:</p><ul><li>Paul Baumgartner, senior project manager in &quot;real life&quot;</li><li>Vasudev Chatti, project manager in &quot;real life&quot;</li><li>Ramakrishna Gundala, senior software engineer in &quot;real life&quot;</li></ul><p>These users were involved from the <a href="Schedule.html">very beginning</a> of the project.  While the &quot;idea&quot; for the project originated from the &quot;perceived need&quot; of the Product Manager, we refined the requirements and functionality through interaction with the users in the following key engagement meetings:</p><ul><li><a href="S2%2B-%2BWireframe%2BReview%2Bwith%2BUsers.html">S2 - Wireframe Review with Users</a></li><li><a href="S4%2B-%2BMockup%2BReview%2Bwith%2BUsers.html">S4 - Mockup Review with Users</a></li><li><a href="S8%2B-%2BUsability%2BReview%2Bwith%2BUsers.html">S8 - Usability Review with Users</a></li></ul><p>A number of usability changes were requested in each of the above user sessions, which were incorporated into <a href="Wireframes.html">wireframes</a>, <a href="Mockups.html">mockups</a>, and the final application.  The majority of the major changes that impacted usability were incorporated.  Due to the tight timeline, these usability changes were not documented as user stories, but rather incorporated into existing work.  The final deployment contains all the usability changes that were approved by the Product Manager.</p>
