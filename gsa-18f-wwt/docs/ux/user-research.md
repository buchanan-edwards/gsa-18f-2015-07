User Research
=====================

_The following provides our initial user research for this project given the time constraints._


## Profiles of Available Users

User 1: Male, tech skill high
User 2: Male, tech skill high
User 3: Female, tech skill medium

## User Interview Questions

1) Do you look up information about medications? Under what circumstances? 
User 1: No. Maybe if prescribed, rarely.
User 2: No.  If I was prescribed not sure of dosage, noticed a side effect and want to know if related to current medication.
User 3: Yes. If I get new prescription.

2) What apps/websites do you use to find drug information?
User 1: WebMD
User 2: Google past ads
User 3: WebMD - trusted source

3) What kind of a device do you typically use?
User 1: 50/50 desktop phone (android)
User 2: iPhone unless site doesn't support or too many ads
User 3: iPhone or iPad 

4) How do you go about finding information (search, title, symptom browse/search)? 
User 1: Google search for name or include symptom
User 2: Look up medication with context, not medication itself
User 3: Google to WebMD, enter drug in search

5) What drug information are you most concerned with?
User 1: Efficacy and suitability for personal purposes, risks
User 2: Dosage, side effects, possible generics that could save $
User 3: Interactions, what exact intentions are (usually found in WebMD or Google)

6) Do you know how to find information about dangerous drug interactions?
User 1: Not really, no special techniques, just reading
User 2: Never been on more than one, assume can find on Internet, e.g., "Can I drink alcohol with medication?" but it's never really clear
User 3: In depth search in WebMD, interaction checker widget available

## User Observation

We were able to observe User 3 going through their current process for finding current medication interactions: 

1) Navigated to WebMD
2) Attempted to search for "prevastid" - no typeahead results - "Maybe I'm not spelling it right?"
3) Navigated to google, search returns semantic results with correct medication name: "Ah, it's 'pra' not 'pre.'"
4) Returns to WebMD, enters correct spelled name, finds typeahead result, clicks
5) Drug description has tabbed information, finds "interactions" tab, clicks
6) "I see there are options for 'researching', 'currently taking', and 'previously taken.'"
7) Adds a med to "currently taking" box, after looking around, sees small message at the top reads "no interactions found."

## Analysis
- Search, either on WebMD or google are most common use cases 
- Semantic results for commonly misspelled drugs (probably fairly common given numerous confusing drug names available) would prevent need to leave site for assistance elsewhere
- Interaction results could be more noticeable, especially if interaction is dangerous
