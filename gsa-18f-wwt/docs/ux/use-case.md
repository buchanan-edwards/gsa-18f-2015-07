Drug Label Browser Use Case
===========================

**Actor**: "Normal" person interested in prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.

**Goal**: Find information about a given drug or class of drugs.

User searches for a drug by name and views the label information online.  Potential side effects and interactions with other drugs are highlighted, as well as any contraindications.  User can potentially "browse" via drug classes or other attributes available via the drug label data service.

**Goal (optional)**: Determine the risk (likelihood X consequences) of using a particular drug

Based upon the frequency and severity of adverse effects, and the number of drug interactions, the website should provide an indication of risk (high/medium/low, or perhaps a score of some sort) for people (maybe by demographic/patient type... e.g., male vs. female, pregnant, age, etc).
