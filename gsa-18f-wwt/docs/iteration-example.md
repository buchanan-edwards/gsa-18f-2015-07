Iteration Example
=================

In general, iteration on projects occurs weekly or bi-weekly depending on the project's and stakeholders' needs. Given the extremely tight deadline, a traditional iteration model did not directly apply to this project. We did, however, still employ iterative strategies (which are more or less habitual at this point) during this project. 

For example, our initial wireframe/prototypes contained a "browse" functionality which would have allowed users to select a letter of the alphabet and read through a list of all of the drugs whose names begin with that letter. It was discovered, however, that this would be a larger-than-expected technical lift, and a big challenge given the other capabilities required for the project in the short time-frame. 

Because we had an embedded Product Owner, as well as a tight feedback loop with our pseudo-customers, we were able to bring this issue up in a turn-around meeting (a quick meeting in the development team area, where the developers literally "turn around" to face each other and work out a problem) and determine that this was a low-priority story (unit of work), and would be put into the "backlog" for this week's work (which, for this project, meant removing some planned functionality to ensure that we would be able to finish the most essential capabilities first). 

Our UX Designer, who was embedded in the team, was then able to take that feedback and generate new wireframes/prototypes without this piece. Additionally, when doing user interviews, we were able to determine that the "browse" functionality was in fact tangential to the main user-path through the application, further confirming the decision made by the various embedded members of the team.

Although this is not generally how we think of an "iteration" at WWT Asynchrony Labs, specifically so far as the time-frame is concerned, the quick-turnaround and design and development pivoting based upon new information from our users, the technology stack, etc., is certainly typical.
