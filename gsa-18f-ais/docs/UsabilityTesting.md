Here are some of the primary Usability inputs we received from our Round#1 Test surveys.

1. Users did not like the extra modal window that congratulated them on creating an account. They found the options of adding additional info and adding medication to be confusing... "it also gives me something extra to click."-user  Remove modal window
2. User found the Drug Recall News useful on the home page but unnecessary on the other pages. "The drug recall news feature on the right seems unnecessary."-user Remove News Recall from every page
3. Users wanted to see notifications easier so we moved it to the top. In the design we will be sure to call it out.
4. Some users found some verbiage to be unclear. For example, the top nav has "My Medications" and the profile has "Current Medications." To fix this I changed the profile to "My Current Medication."
